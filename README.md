# Research Project - Vision Domain

Welcome to our research project in the vision domain! This repository focuses on training the Barlow Twins algorithm on a custom dataset and involves an Optuna-based hyperparameter optimization pipeline. Additionally, the Barlow Twins algorithm will be leveraged as a feature extractor and fine-tuned for a classification task.

## Dependencies
