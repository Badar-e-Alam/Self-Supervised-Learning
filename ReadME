# Research Project - Vision Domain

This repository is part of a research project in the vision domain. The project begins with training the Barlow Twins algorithm on a custom dataset. The pipeline also includes hyperparameter optimization through Optuna.

Following this, the Barlow Twins algorithm will be used as a feature extractor and fine-tuned for the classification task.

## Dependencies

This project requires the following dependencies:

- PyTorch
- Optuna
- FFCV
- Lightly

## To-Do
- Work with the FFCV dataloader to speed up the overall training process.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies.

```bash
pip install torch optuna ffcv lightly
